# health-cost-predictor
This is a learning project where I built a machine learning model to predict health insurance costs based on features like age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. The project includes basic data preprocessing, scaling, and a simple prediction function. Created for practice and understanding ML concepts.
